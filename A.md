### Activation Function: 
A mathematical function used in neural networks to introduce non-linearity, enabling the model to learn complex patterns. Examples include ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh.

### Adversarial Learning: 
A training process where models compete, as in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to improve learning.

### Autoencoder: 
A type of neural network used for unsupervised learning, often to reduce dimensionality or denoise data.
